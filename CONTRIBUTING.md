# Contributing

Feel free to send a pull-request if you have ideas to improve this project, although this is a side project so if it's a large contribution it might be a while before it gets reviewed.

While you're working on the project, the easiest way to test your local changes is to go to chrome://extensions in your chrome browser, turn developer mode on, and load the "chrome-extension" folder as an unpacked extension. Note that users who have "Show me adult content without checking" off will get a warning page when importing from a mature or explicit work, so if you're changing how metadata is imported you should probably check against both page formats.
