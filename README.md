When you post a new work, this extension can help you by importing metadata such as tags and rating to match the work that inspired you. You can also configure a default template for the body of the work.

TODO: add a link to the chrome web store once the extension is publicly available, so people can install it.

## Documentation

The core functionality of this extension, where metadata gets imported and then filled in on the ao3 new work page, is in popup.html/popup.js. options.html/options.js is the corresponding code for this extension's options page.
